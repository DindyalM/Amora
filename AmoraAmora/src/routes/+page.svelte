            </h1>
            <p>
            I have a toolbox of things I will use to take care of myself and make myself feel like a priority in general. I’ve incorporated self care into my daily life and daily routine. When incidents happen I use journaling to explore my feelings, thoughts, reactions and to reflect. I use journaling as a tool to express emotions that I normally would keep repressed and heavy intense emotions I would keep alive within my body. To show self love/ care I have been using my journals as self-therapy focusing on monitoring my thoughts and feelings and reactions that I have to particular situations. I will then dive into uncovering beliefs that are tied to these thoughts. When intense emotions take me over, I allow them to come over me and pass through. A strategy I use is to be with myself when I feel unpleasant feelings in my body, those are the times when I least want to be in my body so I practice allowing these feelings to surface and to be with myself as I go through this process. I will also monitor my thoughts particularly when I begin to feel annoyed and irritated with my emotional state. I created a morning routine that I always follow every morning which helps me feel and see that I am putting myself first as the first priority every morning. I listen to a lot of music, particular music that is part of my culture ( roots, reggae) but music in general has been therapeutic for me. Sometimes I will also draw and doodle depending on how much time I want to spend with myself and how moody I’m feeling. Self-care routine includes allowing one day for myself, where I only do things that are needed for my well-being, for example; facial, hair treatment, making time to clean up.

            The tools I described here I still use. Journaling, morning routines, cultural music, art, making time for hygiene and personal care needs are all part of things I'll do to show myself care and love. As someone living with depression, anxiety and PTSD I've been learning about my mental health as part of my life's journey. My mental health needs have changed and as such, the way I learn about my evolving needs shifts and how to meet these needs and care for these needs has also shifted. In western countries, we always have to ask ourselves how we've internalized capitalism in our own lives. The way we conceptualize care in western countries has roots in institutionalization and professionalization, so yes, our concepts of care are commercialized. Even if we live in a western country, I believe the call to self love and self-care is a call to your Spirit, your Soul, your Intelligence, your Creativity, your Vitality, your Peace. If we become aware of the call and follow it with a heart of sincerity, then we're taken on a journey. Self love and self care has become about knowing who I am and accepting myself.
            </p>
            <div class="pb-8"></div> 
            <p>My relationship with self-love and self-care evolves and isn't static. Using an industrial lens, in my opinion, aims to make self love and self-care static and fixed. As I evolve, my relations with care and love evolves. As I listen to the call, I open myself to learning how to love and how to care, this is dynamic, and life is leading and teaching me. Self- reflexivity and discernment are technologies I use to gauge when liberatory practices are being extorted. In reflection, I am talking to myself. I'm always in a relationship with myself. The tools I described above are some ways I was reconnecting with myself.</p>
            <div class="pb-8"></div> 
            <p>At the time, I was still bumping along, trying new methods to find some sense of inner and outer harmony. I was still unlearning and shedding, making new choices and learning about my responses and resolve. At 23 years old, I had committed to learning how to care for myself and I put myself on different modalities to explore how I responded. I changed the way I ate for my mental health and I wanted to make more caring choices for myself. These were some of my initial desires that led me to self-care and self-love.</p>
